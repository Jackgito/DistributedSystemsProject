**Twitter Clone**

This project implements a simplified Twitter clone application built with Python and Node.js. It utilizes MongoDB as the database, XML-RPC for communication between the Python server and client and RESTful API in the Node.js server.

**Features:**

* User Management:
    * Users can sign up with a username and password. Duplicate usernames are not allowed.
    * Users can log in with their credentials.
* Posting:
    * Users can create and publish tweets containing text, hashtags, and a timestamp.
* Feed:
    * Users can view the 10 most recent tweets.
* Interactions:
    * Users can like and comment on existing tweets.
* Search:
    * Users can search for tweets based on hashtags.

**Technology Stack:**

* Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
* Database: MongoDB
* Communication Protocol: XML-RPC, RESTful API (via Node.js)

## Running the application:

All installation methods requires you to clone the repository and set
the repository root as your current working directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Jackgito/DistributedSystemsProject.git
$Â cd DistributedSystemsProject
```

The client can be run with:

```
$ python3 -m venv client-env
$ ./client-env/bin/python3 client/client.py
```

### Docker compose

This method requires docker to be installed on your system.

Clone the repository and execute docker compose, which will setup the 
node server, python server and mongodb.

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

### Manual server setup

First clone the repository as

###### Requirements

   * Node version 18 or newer
   * Python 3.11 or newer
   
###### Node server

Install required packages using npm and run server.js using node.

```
$ cd node-server
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

###### MongoDB server

Make sure you have the mongodb server runnign on port `27017`, if you
have docker installed, you can run the following command to get mongodb
running:

```
$ docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

###### Python server

```
$ python3 -m venv server-env
$ ./server-env/bin/pip3 install -r server/requirements.txt
$ ./server-env/bin/python3 server/server.py
```

**Code Structure:**

The codebase is divided into three main parts:

* **node-server/server.js:** Handles the interactions with MongoDB through RETSTful API, including user management, post creation, and post fetching. This server utilizes Express.js and Mongoose to manage routes and data schema. 
* **server.py:** Handles communication between the Python client and the Node.js server. Processes client requests, communicates with the Node:js server via HTTP requests and handles XML-RPC responses to the client.
* **client.py:** This file implements the client-side interface. It uses the `xmlrpc.client` library to communicate with the server and displays menus for various user actions like viewing posts, creating posts, searching, and signing out. Additionally, separate modules handle functionalities like authentication, post creation, and search.
